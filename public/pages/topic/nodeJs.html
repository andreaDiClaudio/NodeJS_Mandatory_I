    <p class="paragraph">
        <b>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment for developing server-side applications</b>. It uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine, which compiles and executes JavaScript code. Node.js allows developers to write network applications using JavaScript, which is easier than using other languages like C++ or Java.<br><br>
        Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 when he was working on a web application that required real-time communication between the browser and the server. He needed to create an efficient method of communicating between these two parts of the application, so he created Node.js and released it as open source software under the MIT license on GitHub. The popularity of Node.js grew quickly because of its low resource requirements, its ease of use and its ability to handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently (especially compared to other languages).
        <br><br><b>To run a file</b> with Node.js, you need to use the 'node' command line tool.<br>
        The node command line tool is part of the Node.js installation package, which you can

        from the official website of Node.js.<br><br>
        To run files with Node.js, simply open a terminal window on your computer or IDE and type in:

<div class="paragraph-wrapper">
    <p class="paragraph">
        <b>npm stands for Node Package Manager</b>. It is a package manager for Node.js packages, modules, and libraries. It is free and open-source, and it is used to <b>manage the installation, updating, and removal of Node.js packages</b>.<br><br>
        npm was created in 2009 as a part of the Node.js project. One of the key features of npm is its ability to manage dependencies between packages. npm automatically installs any package dependencies that are required by a package, ensuring that the correct versions are used and that conflicts are avoided. It also provides a mechanism for developers to specify the required version of a package, making it easy to ensure compatibility with existing code.

</div>
<div class="paragraph-wrapper">
    <p class="paragraph">After running the command, we can see files and folders in the root folder that confirm the correct installation of Express. <b>npm generates a folder called 'node_modules'</b> with inside the packages required by Express and two other json files: <b>'package.json' and 'package-lock.json'</b>.<br><br>
        <b>'package.json'</b> is a file that is used in Node.js projects to <b>manage dependencies</b>. It is essentially a manifest file that lists all the dependencies that the project requires to run. These dependencies can include other libraries or packages that are needed by the project. In this file, you can specify the version of the dependency that you want to use as well as other important information like the author, license, and description of the project.<br><br>
        <b>'package-lock.json'</b>, on the other hand, is a file that was introduced in npm version 5 and it <b>ensures that the exact version of each dependency is installed</b>. It also locks the version of each dependency so that it does not change unexpectedly. This is important because it ensures that the project will work consistently across different machines and environments.

<div class="paragraph-wrapper">
    <p class="paragraph">
        Express is a popular and widely used <b>web framework for Node.js</b>. It provides a set of tools and features for building robust and scalable web applications. Express is lightweight, flexible, and easy to use, making it a popular choice for developers who need to build web applications quickly.<br><br>
        Express is built on top of the core Node.js HTTP module, which means that it provides a higher-level API for handling HTTP requests and responses. It also provides a set of middleware functions that can be used to handle common tasks such as parsing request bodies, handling cookies, and handling sessions.<br><br>
        <b>One of the key features of Express is its routing system</b>. Express provides a powerful routing system that allows developers to define routes for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URL patterns. This makes it <b>easy to create RESTful APIs</b> and other web services.
