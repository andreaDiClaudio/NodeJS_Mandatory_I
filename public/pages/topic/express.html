                    Express is a popular and widely used web framework for Node.js. It provides a set of tools and features for building robust and scalable web applications. Express is lightweight, flexible, and easy to use, making it a popular choice for developers who need to build web applications quickly.<br><br>
                    Express is built on top of the core Node.js HTTP module, which means that it provides a higher-level API for handling HTTP requests and responses. It also provides a set of middleware functions that can be used to handle common tasks such as parsing request bodies, handling cookies, and handling sessions.<br><br>
                    One of the key features of Express is its routing system. Express provides a powerful routing system that allows developers to define routes for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URL patterns. This makes it easy to create RESTful APIs and other web services.

                    The first step is to <a href="/packageManager&Dependencies" target="blank" style="color: #e7793e;">install the package</a> create the 'app.js' file in the root folder of the project. It is that it is the main file of the application. It contains the logic to initialize the application, including loading modules, setting up middleware, and defining routes. The app.js file is typically the first file that is executed when the application is started, and it is responsible for starting the server and listening for incoming requests. It is also responsible for handling errors and providing a response to the client. In short, the app.js file is the heart of the application, and it is where most of the application logic is defined.<br><br>

                    • Query String Parameters
                    <br>You can send data in a GET request by including it in the URL as query string parameters. For example, you can send data to a server by appending it to the URL in the following format: ?key1=value1&key2=value2. The server can then extract the data from the query string parameters.
                    <br><br>
                    • URL path parameters
                    <br>You can also send data in a GET request by including it in the URL path. This is typically done when the data is used to identify a specific resource. For example, you can send data to a server by including it in the URL path in the following format: /resource/:id, where :id is a variable that represents the data being sent.
