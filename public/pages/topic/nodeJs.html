                    Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment for developing server-side applications. It uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine, which compiles and executes JavaScript code. Node.js allows developers to write network applications using JavaScript, which is easier than using other languages like C++ or Java.
                    <br><br>Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 when he was working on a web application that required real-time communication between the browser and the server. He needed to create an efficient method of communicating between these two parts of the application, so he created Node.js and released it as open source software under the MIT license on GitHub. The popularity of Node.js grew quickly because of its low resource requirements, its ease of use and its ability to handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently (especially compared to other languages).
                    <br><br>
                    To run a file with Node.js, you need to use the 'node' command line tool.<br> The node command line tool is part of the Node.js installation package, which you can <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target=”_blank” style="color: #e7793e;">download</a> from the official website of Node.js.<br><br>To run files with Node.js, simply open a terminal window on your computer or IDE and type in:

                JavaScript is a dynamic language with dynamic types. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types. <br><br>
                In Javascript, datatypes are divided into two categories: primitive and object.<br>Primitive datatypes are built-in to the language and include include numbers, strings, booleans, null and undefined. <br>Objects are created using constructors and have properties that can be accessed using dot notation (e.g., myObject.propertyName).<br><br>Primitive Datatypes in JavaScript

                Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another (such as strings to numbers). Type conversion is similar to type coercion because they both convert values from one data type to another with one key difference — type coercion is implicit whereas type conversion can be either implicit or explicit.<br><br>
                There are some downsides to this type of coercion: It can lead to unexpected results in your code; It can cause performance issues if you use it improperly, since it involves extra work by the computer; It can introduce bugs into your code if you're not careful about which types are being coerced and how they should be handled.

            <p>4. Loose vs. Strict Equality Operator</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-wrapper">
            <p class="paragraph">
                In JavaScript, there's both the double equality operator (== which is called the loose equality operator) and the triple equality operator (=== which is called the strict equality operator). You use both operators to compare values' equality.
                <br><br>
                The loose equality operator does a loose check. It checks if values are equal. The types are not a focus for this operator - only the values are the major factor.
            </p>
            <div class="code-snippet-wrapper">
                <pre class="code-snippet-tab">
        <code class="code">const variable1 = 20;</code>
        <code class="code">const variable2 = "20";</code><br>
        <code class="code">console.log(variable1 == variable2);// true</code>
                </pre>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph" style="padding-top: 20px;">
                When you use the loose equality operator with values of different types, what happens first is coercion. Again, this is where one value is converted to the type that fits the other, before the comparison occurs.
    
                In this case, the string "20" is converted to a number type (which is 20) and then compared with the other value, and they are both equal.  
                <br><br>
                The strict equality operator does a strict check – that is, it strictly checks the values compared, as well as the types. Type coercion does not occur here, so there are no unexpected answers.

                REST API is an application programming interface that does not store the state of the client. It is used to interact with a web service. A REST API uses HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to communicate with the server and perform actions like creating, updating and deleting resources. It is a communication that follows the client-server model: the user sends a request, the server sends a response.
