                Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment for developing server-side applications. It uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine, which compiles and executes JavaScript code. Node.js allows developers to write network applications using JavaScript, which is easier than using other languages like C++ or Java.
                <br><br>Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 when he was working on a web application that required real-time communication between the browser and the server. He needed to create an efficient method of communicating between these two parts of the application, so he created Node.js and released it as open source software under the MIT license on GitHub. The popularity of Node.js grew quickly because of its low resource requirements, its ease of use and its ability to handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently (especially compared to other languages).
